# UBC Solar â€“ Lower Control Arm Design (Gen 4 Vehicle)

## Overview
This branch documents the **design, analysis, and validation** of the suspension lower control arms for **UBC Solarâ€™s fourth-generation solar vehicle**.  
The project focuses on achieving an optimal balance between **performance**, **manufacturability**, and **structural integrity** under race conditions.

## Objectives
- Reduce component weight while maintaining stiffness and fatigue life  
- Validate safety under realistic load cases (**2g bump**, **1g cornering**, **1g braking**)  
- Justify and simulate the use of a **pull-rod rocker geometry** for improved ride dynamics  
- Ensure manufacturability with clear **GD&T** and serviceability considerations  

## Key Work
- Designed and modeled control arms using **SolidWorks**  
- Performed **ANSYS FEA** simulations to verify stress and fatigue safety  
- Conducted a mini research study on **suspension geometry** using a **2DOF dynamic model** converted into a **Fourier series** to analyze ride behavior  
- Achieved a **50% weight reduction** by replacing steel with a **aluminum 6061 T6**  
- Produced detailed **engineering drawings** for manufacturing  

## Technologies Used
`SolidWorks` â€¢ `ANSYS` â€¢ `MATLAB` â€¢ `Fourier Analysis` â€¢ `Suspension Kinematics` â€¢ `Material Selection`
