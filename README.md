# UBC Solar ‚Äì Steering Wheel Redesign (Gen 3 Vehicle)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project reached full **design completion and validation**; however, the team ultimately chose to proceed with an **aluminum 6061-T6 baseplate** due to time constraints and material testing limitations for the composite prototype.

## Overview
This branch documents the **design, analysis, and fabrication-ready model** of the steering wheel for **UBC Solar‚Äôs third-generation solar vehicle**.  
The redesign focused on improving **ergonomics, weight distribution, and electronic integration**, while ensuring structural reliability and manufacturability under racing conditions.

## Objectives
- Develop a **lightweight, driver-centric steering wheel** for improved comfort and performance  
- Integrate **signal routing** through an embedded PCB to streamline wiring and assembly  
- Validate **composite and aluminum alternatives** through FEA to ensure stiffness and safety  
- Ensure manufacturability with **clear tolerancing and mounting compatibility** with the quick-release hub  

## Key Work
- Designed the full steering wheel assembly and hub interface in **SolidWorks**, incorporating ergonomic grip geometry and switch placement  
- Conducted **composite FEA simulations** in **ANSYS ACP** to assess fiber orientation, strength, and deflection under torsional and bending loads  
- Compared composite and aluminum variants, leading to the final selection of an **aluminum 6061-T6 baseplate** for reliability and ease of machining  
- Collaborated with the **Power & Signals sub-team** to embed a custom PCB and optimize internal wiring and connector routing  
- Delivered **manufacturing drawings** and assembly documentation for fabrication and integration into the Gen 3 cockpit
